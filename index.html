            <p>
                Regular exercise and physical activity are very important to the health and abilities of older people.
                When older people lose their ability to do things on their own, it doesn't happen just because they
                haveaged. More likely, it is because they have become inactive. Older inactive adults lose ground in
                fourareas that are important for staying healthy and independent: endurance, strength, balance, and
                flexibility.
